# VBA_Scripting_Project

In this project I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.


I used two files which were

Test Data - I used this while I developed my scripts.
Stock Data - I ran these scripts on the data to generate the final report.

I created a script that looped through each year of stock data and grabed the total 
amount of volume each stock had over the year. I also displayed the ticker symbol to
coincide with the total volume.

(note: all solution images are for 2015 data).
